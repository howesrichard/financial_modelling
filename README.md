# financial_modelling
This is a public repository containing material for the teaching of financial modelling.

It is created by me, Richard Howes, and it is not owned by any university or teaching organisation even though I perform work for several such organisations.

It is to be used in a variety of teaching and self-directed learning contexts including: 
- Students at the University of Queensland enrolled in BAFE and studying FINM4022 will be users of this material.
- Participants at the Financial Markets Academy will be users of this material.
- Other.
